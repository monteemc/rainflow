Simple implementation of RainFlow cycle count algorithm for fatigue analysis, as
a direct adaptation of 5.4.4 algorithm ASTM E1049-85 [1].

Also adequate data types and functions are provided to manipulate:
 - stress histories;
 - simple alternate / mean stresses pair cycle counts;
 - bin alternate / mean stresses pair cycle counts.

2DO:
- Auxiliar library to work with S-N curves and mean stress correction;
- Damage calculation - Palgrem-Miner rule;
-...


Disclaimer: this is my first Haskell project. It's totaly experimental - do not trust for real engineering work (at least yet).
